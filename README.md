TITLE:AUTOMATED RAILWAYGATE CONTROLLER USING HIGH SPEED ALERTING SYSTEM

Abstract
The objective of this project is to provide an automatic railway gate at a level crossing
replacing the gates operated by the gatekeeper.The system reduces the time for
which the gate remains closed. The system works on a micro-controller based
control. The proposed system uses Arduino Uno micro-controller. With the help of IR
sensors, the arrival and leaving of the system is monitored and the gate is operated
accordingly with the help of Servo/DC Motor.

Working
- Detection of train by IR Sensor : When train arrives near crossing the sensor
  detects its motion and then it closes the crossing way of cars or other vehicles.
- When the train further crosses the cross way other sensor detects the motion
  and opens the cross way.
- The detection of objects by IR sensor controls the motion of DC motor which
  monitors the motion of Cross Way.
